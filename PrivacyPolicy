Privacy Policy for ActiveGuard


ActiveGuard ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices related to data collection, usage, and protection.

1. No Data Collection
We respect your privacy and do not collect, store, or process any personal information, usage data, or device data when you use ActiveGuard. Our application is designed to function without gathering any client information or interacting with external servers or databases.

2. Subscription Management
If you subscribe to ActiveGuard, any billing and subscription-related data is managed solely by the platform through which you subscribed (e.g., the Microsoft Store). ActiveGuard itself does not handle or store any subscription or billing information directly.

3. Data Security
Since ActiveGuard does not collect or store any personal information, there is no client data requiring protection. The app operates exclusively on your device, without transmitting information to us or any third parties.

4. Children’s Privacy
ActiveGuard is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age. Since the app does not collect any data, it inherently complies with children’s privacy requirements.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any updates will be posted within the app. Your continued use of ActiveGuard after such changes will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated policy.
